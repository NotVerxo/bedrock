# ⚠️ READ IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT

ALWAYS launch minecraft with the custom launcher, if you don't the game will just be a trial version again.

CLOSE your antivirus (doesn't matter which one, always close it because it thinks it is a false positive).

add the Launcher.exe file as an exclusion to prevent the windows defender from deleting it if it turns on by itself. (Heres a quick tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v-HevRWzMk)
